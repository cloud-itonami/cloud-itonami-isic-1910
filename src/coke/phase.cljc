  "Phase table for Coke Operations state graph.

  NOTE: this is a plain descriptive EDN map of the intended graph
  topology (nodes/edges/predicates) plus small structural helpers
  (`starting-node`, `is-terminal?`) used by tests and `sim.cljc` --
  it is NOT compiled or run through `langgraph.graph/state-graph`.
  `coke.sim` actually drives the workflow as a plain function pipeline
  (advisor proposal -> `governor/evaluate`), not this table. A real
  langgraph-clj StateGraph (with `g/run*`/interrupt-before human
  sign-off) is a known gap for this actor's upgrade from :blueprint to
  :implemented; see e.g. cloud-itonami-isco-1221's salesmgmt.actor for
  the target shape.")
